// a namespace is kind of like an object. Just a collection of stuff merged
// together. Could do:
baz.biz;

// how to test for a value: Should be able to assign it to an identifier. Works
// for foo (because it is a value):
const x = foo; // foo is in the value position (RHS).
// Try it with the interface:
const n = bar; // Nope: "'bar' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here."

// how to test for a type: try to use it as a type. If you can do that
// successfully, then it can be regarded as a type. Can do bar:
const y: bar = {}; // bar is in the type position (LHS).
// Cannot do foo:
const b: foo = {}; //'foo' refers to a value, but is being used as a type here. Did you mean 'typeof foo'?
let c: foo;

// how to test for a namespace: must rely on tooltips for that (hover over baz symbol)

// Takeaway: knowing what's a type, and knowing what's a value...will take you a

// kind of have to leave alone when they're defined in types (values).
